### Today will be the seventh class !ðŸ™‚

---

_I will talk about the class seven from the selected chpters of the reuirments_
_mainly we will be talking about *Tables* , *Functions and objects and moudle and Domain Modeling*_

---

1- Tables: <br />to create a table we use the table tag,<br /> What next? we need a row; we use tr tag to indicate the row, <br />and then? we need a cell; using td tag opening and closing, what if we need a heading with the tr we use th opening and closing tag<br />
now what if we have a long table? in this case we will use the table tag followed by thead tag<br /> witch is the heading of the table, then the tbody tag witch is the body inside the table<br /> and then we need tfoot tag witch is the footer.

2- Functions: <br />
functions is a container for some statments, to run a specific task, so if another part of the script repeat the same task we can reuse the function.<br />
a- declaring the function: we give it a name and thenn we write the statment need to achieve inside curly brackets. <br />
b- calling the function: after declaring the function we can execute all of the statments between the curly braces in just one line.<br />
c- declaring function that needs information by giving it parameters the parameters will act like variables,<br /> and when we want to call it we have to specify the value it should use in the parantheses that follow its name we call the value arguments.<br />
d- getting a single value out of a function: some functions return information to the code that called them by the key word return.<br />
e- getting multiple values out of a function: function can return more than one value using an array.<br />
f- function decleration and function expression : decleration we can call it later, expression when i expect to see exprisionn ,,,<br />
j- there is local var and global var.<br />

3: Objects: <br /> I should read it again

---

4: Moudle:<br />I should read it again

---

5: Domain Modeling: <br /> Domain modeling is the process of creating a solution model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's show well can verify your understanding of that problem.
