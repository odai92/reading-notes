_mainly we will be talking about *Tables* , *Functions and objects and moudle and Domain Modeling*_

1- Tables: <br />to create a table we use the table tag,<br /> What next? we need a row; we use tr tag to indicate the row, <br />and then? we need a cell; using td tag opening and closing, what if we need a heading with the tr we use th opening and closing tag<br />
now what if we have a long table? in this case we will use the table tag followed by thead tag<br /> witch is the heading of the table, then the tbody tag witch is the body inside the table<br /> and then we need tfoot tag witch is the footer.
