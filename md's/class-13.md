## _mainly we will be talking about *Local Storage for Web Applications*_

localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key/value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is closed<br />
One of the most useful new features in HTML5 is the standardization of local storage.<br /> Finally, Web developers can stop trying to fit all client-side data into 4 KB Cookies.<br />
Now you can store large amounts of data on the client with a simple API. This is a perfect mechanism for caching, so you can dramatically improve the speed of your application,<br />
A critical factor for mobile Web applications that rely on much slower connections than their desktop brothers. In this tutorial, you will see how to use local storage, how to debug it, <br /> and you will see a variety of ways to use it to improve mobile Web applications.
As websites became more dynamic and data-driven, the need to store data on the client side increased. In many scenarios, web applications need to manage their own state and data, whether to make the app more efficient or because the servers are becoming stateless, and storing client‚Äôs data is either insecure or inappropriate.
<br /> For a long time, HTTP cookies were used for this, but they have their own limitations and may not be the ideal solution.
sessionStorage ‚Äì Web storage implementation that stores data during a page session.
<br /> The data is deleted once the session is over, for example when the browser is closed.
localStorage ‚Äì Web storage implementation that is persistent across multiple sessions even when the browser is closed and reopened. <br />
The two implementations share the same interface and have their own use case. We will focus on localStorage only.
