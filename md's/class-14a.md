## _this read is talking about CSS3 and how to use the amazing techniques_

- Pure CSS Bounce Animation:~ so they created 3 div's and gave them different classes and inside each div there is a div with class ball,using keyframes they created an animations and they called the classes as well.<br />

- 404:~ 3 html h1 element were called by nth child and transform translate was used then they moved the html elements by keyframes.<br />
- CSS3 Animations: Keyframes:~ this page is not working.<br />

- 6 Buttons animated:~ this one is amazing, they made a div have 3 buttons each button took a style and class i can see new key wrods like -webkit-animation-delay, @-webkit-keyframes, animation-play-state.<br />

- 8 simple CSS3 transitions that will wow your users:~ the transition has three values: properties to transition and the speed and acceleration and deceleration calculated .<br />

- fade, change color, grow-shrink, rotate, square to circle, 3d shadow, swing and inset border.<br />

- Transitions & Animations:~ It is important to note, not all properties may be transitioned, only properties that have an identifiable halfway point. Colors, font sizes, and the alike may be transitioned from one value to another as they have recognizable values in-between one another. The display property, for example, may not be transitioned as it does not have any midpoint.<br />

- Transforms:~ general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements.
