Controlling size of images in CSS<br/>
to control thw aize of an image using the width and heigh properties in CSS, specifying the size tells the browser <br/>
how mush space to leave for an image so no need to wait the image to download<br/>
we add selectors for each of the class name<br/>

we can make a background image using the propertie background-image: url('') inside the body or any other tag to be specified<br/>

- background-repeat: <br/>
  1- repeat: reapeated both horizonatally and vertically.<br/>
  2- repeat-x: repeated horizonatally only<br/>
  3- repeat-y: repeated vertically only<br/>
  4-no repeat: img shown once only, it may have two values <br/> background-attachment:~<br/>
  a- fixed: img stays same postion<br/>
  b- scrol: img moves up and down as the scroll<br/>

using the float property to align images, also we add a margin to ensure nothing touch the edges aroun<br/>
centering images using css:~ the display should turn into block cuz its inline by default , and then use the marginn to set left and right margin to auto<br/>
background position:<br/>
left top<br/>
left center, left bottom, center top, center center, center bottom, right top, right center, right bottom<br/>
