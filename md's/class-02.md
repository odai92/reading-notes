- HTML pages are text documents. HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angledbrackets) to give the information they surround special meaning. <br />
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
  the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
  the end. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
  about the content of that element. <br />
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
  available for you to use, what they do, and where they
  can go.

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
  its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
  element should look.<br />
- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
  elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
  indicate what these elements should look like).<br />
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your
  rules at different elements.
  \_ Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
  of the element that you want to change, and the values
  of those properties. For example, the font-family
  property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
  specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
  **_CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
  although they may appear within an HTML page._**

- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
  statement is like a step in a recipe.<br />
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
  you might specify that a value must be remembered
  before creating a calculation using that value.<br />
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
  information used in the script.
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more
  than one piece of related information.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
  strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
  Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

---

- Functions allow you to group a set of related
  statements together that represent a single task.
  Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
  to do their job) and may return a value.
- **_An object is a series of variables and functions that
  represent something from the world around you._**
  In an object, variables are known as properties of the
  object; functions are known as methods of the object.
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both
  the browser window and the document loaded into the
  browser window.
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
  String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
  methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
  Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
  sets (and both can contain the other).
