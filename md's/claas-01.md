_How the Web Works?_
-When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

### The book intreduced me to these subjects:

- HTML Describes the Structure of Pages
  _The first line of code, <!DOCTYPE html>, is called a doctype declaration and tells the browser which version of HTML the page is written in. In this case, weâ€™re using the doctype that corresponds to HTML5, the most up-to-date version of the HTML language. There are a number of different doctype declarations that correspond to various versions of HTML._
- Attributes Tell Us More About Elements
  _The HTML head element is a container that can include a number of HTML elements that are not visible parts of the page rendered by the browser. These elements are either metadata that describe information about the page or are helping pull in external resources like CSS stylesheets or JavaScript files._
  _There can only be one <body> element in an HTML document because this element is the container that holds the content of the document. All of the content that you see rendered in the browser is contained within this element. In the example above, the content of the page is a headline and simple paragraph._
