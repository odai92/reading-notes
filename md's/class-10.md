## _the most common thing always happened when codding_

## **no one is perfect**

error handling and debuging <br />
no one was born know how to use javascript, even the experensied people make mistakes while using javascripts, so this upcoming chapter we will talk more about how to find the errors<br />
**_its a problme üè• solving a problme._**
hopfully we will learn more about the console and dev tools that helps to hunt the errors, we will talk about some common problems, handling erros<br >

there is one global execution context: every statment lives in one of three contexts global the code in the script, function context being run within a function and eval context.<br />

whenever a script enter a new execution contxt, there are two phases of activity :<br />
1-prepare: scope created => var & fun and arguments are created => vale determined<br />
2- execute: assign values to var => reference fun and run code => execute statment

error objects can help to find where your mistakes ar and browsers have tools to help you read them<br />

here is the important thing:<br />
i will type the error property and its description;<br />
name: type execution<br />
message: description<br />
fileNumber: name of the file js<br />
lineNumber: line number of error<br />

ok i will show the seven types of built in error objects in js<br />
error: generic error<br />
syntax error: syntax has not been follow???<br />
reference error: tried to reference a var that is not declaredd<br />
typeerror: numbers not in acceptable range<br />
urierror: i never saw it<br />
eval error: eval funtion used incorrectly<br />

two thing to do with error:<br />
debug the cript to fix error, like what mr waleed did today with my js page<br />
handle errors gracefully, like when mr tamim make code reviw for my collegues<br />

always search for :<br />
where is the problme.<br />
what exactly is the problme.<br />

## the console helps narrow down the area in wich the eroor is located, so you can try to find the exact error<br />

# see you tommorow
